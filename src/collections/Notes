MANAGING GROUPS OF DATA
    - Arrays is the most simple way to manage data
        - But they are statically sized
        - Requires explicit position management
    - Collections are a more powerful way to manage data
    - The Role of Collections
        - Hold and organize data
            - Iterable
            - Can be typed
            - Dynamically sized
    - Most simple collection is just a list
    - Some provide ordering, or prevent duplication, or allowing value pairs

COLLECTIONS AND TYPE SAFETY
    - ArrayList will default to type Object if no type is given
        - Done through the power of generics
    - Usually we will restrict the object type of a collection
    - Generics allow us to restrict the type of objects something can
        operate on.

COLLECTION INTERFACE
    - Common features across collections come from the Collection interface
        - Extends the Iterable interface
    - Methods
        size = returns number of elements
        clear = removes all elements
        isEmpty = returns true if no elements
        add = add a single element
        addAll = add all members from another collection
        contains = return true if contains elements
        containsAll = return true if it contains all the elements of another collection
        remove = remove an element
        removeAll = remove all elements contained in another collect
        retainAll = remove all elements not contained in another collection

        All these use the equals method

NEW WITH JAVA 8
- Lamba expressions
    - Make it to where we can pass code as arguments
    - There's another course on it

    - Collection methods with lamba's
        - forEach
        - removeIf

CONVERTING FROM COLLECTIONS AND ARRAYS
- Can convert a collection to an array using toArray() with no arguments
    - or use toArray(t[]array) to return an array of type T
- Arrays can be converted to a collection using asList();

DIFFERENT COLLECTION TYPES
    - Collection interfaces
        - Gives the contract
        - Collection
        - List - maintains order
        - Queue - specific order with a head element
        - Set - collection with no duplicates
        - SortedSet - no duplicates and sorted
    - Collection classes
        - ArrayList - list that should be read randomly
        - LinkedList - list that should be set randomly
        - HashSet - a set and has table
        - TreeSet - sortedSet

SORTING
    - Can be done using the comparable interface
    - Comparable should be consistent with the equals method
    - Comparator interface
        - Perform a sort
        - Allows one type to set the sort behavior for another

MAPS
    - Consist of a key/value pairs
    - Each key is unique, but there can be duplicate values or null values

    Interfaces
        - Map - basic map operations
        - SortedMap - map whose keys are sorted
    Classes
        - HashMap - general purpose map
        - TreeMap - sorted map, has comparable and comparator

    Map Interface methods
        - put - add key and value
        - putIfAbsent - add if key is absent or value for key is null
        - get - return value for key or null for not found
        - getOrDefault - same as get, but returns default value instead of null
        values - get a colletion of all the values
        - keySet - get a set of the keys contained
        - forEach
        - replaceAll - lambda for each keys value

SORTED MAP

    - Methods
        firstKey = returns first key
        lastKey = returns last key
        headMap = returns map for all keys less than certain value
        tailMap = returns map for all keys greater than or equal to the value passed.
        subMap = returns map for keys greater than or equal to starting key and less than ending key
